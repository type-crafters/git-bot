# Thank you for inviting GitBot!

GitBot's role in your server is to notify users when a repository you're interested in has had any recent activity.

## Getting started

By default, GitBot will send notifications to the current channel. To change the channel to which GitBot sends messages, use the `/gitbot channel` **(NOT IMPLEMENTED)** command.
